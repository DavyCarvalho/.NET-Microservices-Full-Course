# .NET-Microservices-Full-Course

Repositorio destinado ao código escrito durante o curso ".NET Microservices – Full Course" do canal Les Jackson (Youtube). 

Descrição do conteúdo do curso: In this step-by-step tutorial I take you through an introduction on building microservices using .NET. As the name suggests we build everything completely from start to finish –with the full scope of the course outlined in the time-stamp section below. However, at a high-level we’ll cover:
• Building two .NET Microservices using the REST API pattern
• Working with dedicated persistence layers for both services 
• Deploying our services to Kubernetes cluster • Employing the API Gateway pattern to route to our services
• Building Synchronous messaging between services (HTTP &amp; gRPC)
• Building Asynchronous messaging between services using an Event Bus (RabbitMQ)
